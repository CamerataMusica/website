<h3>About the Musicians</h3>
<p><strong>Paul O'Dette,</strong></p>
<p><em>“…should
I come to meet Saint Peter at the pearly gates, I hope he will say, ‘Welcome,
good and faithful servant! By the way, be sure to hear Paul O’Dette—he’s
leading the angel band.’”</em> Early Music America</p>
<p>Paul O'Dette has been described as “the clearest case of genius ever to touch his
instrument.” (Toronto Globe and Mail) One of the most influential figures in his field, O'Dette has
helped define the technical and stylistic standards to which
twenty-first-century performers of early music aspire. In doing so, he helped
infuse the performance practice movement with a perfect combination of
historical awareness, idiomatic accuracy, and ambitious self-expression.</p>
<p>Paul O'Dette has made more than 140 recordings, winning two Grammys, seven
Grammy nominations and numerous other international record awards. “The
Complete Lute Music of John Dowland” (a 5-CD set for harmonia mundi usa), was
awarded the prestigious <em>Diapason D'or de
l'année</em>, while “The Royal Lewters” received the <em>Diapason D’or</em>, a <em>Choc du
Monde de la Musique</em>, a 5-star rating in <em>BBC
Music Magazine</em>, 5-star rating in <em>Goldberg</em>
and a perfect score of 10 from ClassicsToday.com. “The Bachelar’s Delight: Lute
Music of Daniel Bacheler” was nominated for a GRAMMY in 2006 as “Best Solo
Instrumental Recording.”</p>
<p>Mr. O'Dette is also active conducting Baroque operas. His recent recording
of Charpentier’s <em>La Descente d’Orphée aux
Enfers</em> with the Boston Early Music Festival Chamber Ensemble won a GRAMMY
for “Best Opera Recording of 2014,” as well as an Echo Klassik Award in the
same category. In 1997 he began a collaboration with Stephen Stubbs,
co-directing performances of Baroque operas, beginning with Luigi Rossi's <em>L'Orfeo</em> at Tanglewood, the Boston Early
Music Festival (BEMF) and the Drottningholm Court Theatre in Sweden. Since 1999
they have co-directed performances of Cavalli's <em>Ercole Amante</em> at the Boston Early Music Festival, Tanglewood, and
the Utrecht Early Music Festival, Provenzale's <em>La Stellidaura Vendicata</em> at the Vadstena Academy in Sweden,
Monteverdi's <em>Orfeo</em> and <em>L'Incoronazione di Poppea</em> for Festival
Vancouver, Lully's <em>Thésée</em>, Conradi’s <em>Ariadne</em> (Hamburg, 1691) Mattheson’s <em>Boris Goudenow</em>, Lully’s <em>Psyché</em>, Monteverdi’s <em>Poppea</em> and <em>Ulisse</em>, Handel’s <em>Acis and
Galatea</em>, Steffani’s <em>Niobe _andHandel’s</em> Almira <em>for the Boston Early Music Festival. Their recording of _Ariadne</em> was nominated for a GRAMMY as
“Best Opera Recording of 2005,” <em>Thésée</em>  in 2007 and <em>Psyché</em> in 2008. Their most recent opera recording, <em>Niobe</em>, was awarded a <em>Diapason D’or de l’année</em>, <em>Echo Klassik
Award</em>, the <em>Jahrespreis der
Deutschenschallplattenkritik</em>, and was nominated for this year’s Grammys.
Paul O'Dette has guest directed numerous Baroque orchestras and opera
productions on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
<p>In addition to his activities as a performer, Paul O'Dette is an avid
researcher, having worked extensively on the performance and sources of
seventeenth-century Italian and English solo song, continuo practices and lute
music. He has published numerous articles on issues of historical performance
practice and co-authored the Dowland entry in the <em>New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians</em>.</p>
<p>Paul O'Dette is Professor of Lute and Director of Early Music at the
Eastman School of Music and Artistic Director of the Boston Early Music
Festival.</p>
<p><strong>Ronn McFarlane</strong></p>
<p>GRAMMY­nominated
lutenist, Ronn McFarlane strives to bring the lute ­ the most popular
instrument of the Renaissance ­ into today’s musical mainstream and make it
accessible to a wider audience.</p>
<p>Born in West Virginia,
Ronn grew up in Maryland. At thirteen, upon hearing “Wipeout” by the Surfaris,
he fell madly in love with music and taught himself to play on a “cranky
sixteen­dollar steel string guitar.” Ronn kept at it, playing blues and rock
music on the electric guitar while studying classical guitar.  He graduated with honors from Shenandoah
Conservatory and continued guitar studies at Peabody Conservatory before
turning his full attention and energy to the lute in 1978.  The next year, Mr. McFarlane began to perform
solo recitals on the lute and became a member of the Baltimore Consort. Since
then, he has toured throughout the United States, Canada and Europe with the
Baltimore Consort and as a soloist.</p>
<p>McFarlane was a faculty
member of the Peabody Conservatory from 1984 to 1995, teaching lute and
lute-related subjects.  In 1996, Mr.
McFarlane was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Music from Shenandoah
Conservatory for his achievements in bringing the lute and its music to the
world.  He has over 35 recordings on the
Dorian/Sono Luminus label, including solo albums, lute duets, flute &amp; lute
duets, lute songs, the complete lute music of Vivaldi, a collection of
Elizabethan lute music and poetry, and recordings with the Baltimore Consort.</p>
<p>Ronn has composed new
music for the lute, building on the tradition of the lutenist/composers of past
centuries.  His original compositions are
the focus of his solo CD, <em>Indigo Road</em>,
which received a GRAMMY Award Nomination for Best Classical Crossover Album of
2009.  In 2010 Ronn founded Ayreheart, an
ensemble brought together to perform new compositions as well as early music.
Ayreheart’s first CD release, <em>One Morning</em>,
consists of all­original music by Ronn McFarlane.  Ayreheart’s 2016 release, <em>Barley Moon</em>, blends folk music and art
music from Renaissance and Medieval England, Scotland and Wales.</p>
