<p><strong>The Borealis Wind Quintet</strong>, nominated for a 2006 Grammy Award in the Chamber Music Category, is acclaimed as one of America's preeminent chamber ensembles. The highest musical integrity, irresistible energy and five-fold charisma distinguish Borealis in the chamber music field. Audiences love their exquisite programming that includes the finest of the classics, engaging commissioned works, opera arias and works for piano and winds. The Washington Post praised their "sensitive collaborations that have a sophisticated and cosmopolitan air." Peter G. Davies of the New York Times described one concert as "a polished, elegantly turned performance...each work received lively, expert and musicianly treatment by this skilled and exceptionally talented chamber group."
