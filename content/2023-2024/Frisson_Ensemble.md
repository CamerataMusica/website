### About

Frission features the best and brightest of classical music's stars!  The group showcases emerging young artists as well as seasoned professionals and has skyrocketed to become one of the leading musical groups.  Frission performs engaging programs for winds, piano trio, and piano quartet programs, as well as popular programs featuring music by such composers as Gershwin and Piazzolla.  The ensemble performs in over 25 cities annually including appearances in such diverse venues as the Morgan Library and Museum in New York City, for the Da Camera Society in Los Angeles, and at the Bermuda Festival.

Frission comes from the French word meaning "a shiver or a thrill, a sudden feeling of excitement."
