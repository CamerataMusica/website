### About

Originally starting as a duo on the piano, the Park Brothers transformed into a duo on two guitars. Both Alex and Wesley Park started their music education on the piano at an early age, then began their guitar studies in their teen years. They both studied classical guitar at Pepperdine University under Christopher Parkening, celebrated as one of the world's preeminent virtuosos of the classical guitar, and they came together as a guitar duo. The brothers enjoy collaborating and working together, as they complement each other with a natural synergy of sounds.

The Park Brothers have performed together as far away as Canada, Austria, and Germany. Together, they are the recipient of the USC Thornton Ensemble Award for making a significant contribution to upholding the long tradition of guitar ensemble excellence. They also performed at a tribute concert honoring the great Spanish guitarist Andrés Segovia alongside the Grammy Award winning artists, the Los Angeles Guitar Quartet and Andrew York in 2019. They have participated in masterclasses from Christopher Parkening, Angel Romero, Andrew York, Jason Vieaux, Scott Tennant, Jubilant Sykes, and Meng Su.  In the 2014 Pacific Guitar Competition in Monrovia, CA, they placed as a finalist in the chamber mixed division category. The Park Brothers guitar duo are signed under Jean Schreiber Management.
