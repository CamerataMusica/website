Every year, Camerata celebrates the end of the season with a tribute to local music students.  About 15-20 participants are selected from a group nominated by their teachers on the basis of performance at adjudications and competitions. 

Information about requirements and the nomination form will be posted soon.

Music teachers can download the [application form (Word DOC)]({filename}/images/ApplicationForm.doc).
