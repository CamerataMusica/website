### About the Musicians

Founded in 1980 to perform the instrumental music of Shakespeare’s time, the Baltimore Consort has
explored early English, Scottish, and French popular music, focusing on the relationship between folk and
art song and dance. Their interest in early music of English/Scottish heritage has also led them to delve into
the rich trove of traditional music preserved in North America. Recordings on the Dorian label have earned
them recognition as Top Classical-Crossover Artist of the Year (_Billboard_), as well as rave reviews elsewhere.
Besides touring in the U.S. and abroad, they often perform on such syndicated radio broadcasts as _St. Paul
Sunday, Performance Today, Harmonia_ and the CBC’s _OnStage_.
