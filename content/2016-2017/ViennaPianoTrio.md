### About the Musicians

Founded in 1988 and celebrated for its finesse, infectious exuberance, tonal allure, and  irresistible panache, the Vienna Piano has long been hailed as one of the world’s top piano trios by audiences and the media alike.  Since September 2015, this reputation is being kept alive with David McCarroll as the new violinist who brings to this ensemble an extensive knowledge of the chamber music repertoire. He studied with prominent teachers in Boston and Berlin and has already collaborated with renowned artists on both sides of the Atlantic.

The Vienna Piano Trio performs in the major concert halls worldwide.  In North America, it appeared, among others, in New York City (Lincoln Center, Weil Recital Hall, Frick Collection) Washington (Kennedy Center, National Gallery, Library of Congress), in Baltimore,  Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, Seattle, Vancouver, Toronto, Montreal, Mexico City, and the Caribbean.

In addition, the trio has been invited to many leading music festivals, including the Schubertiade Schwarzenberg,  Wiener Festwochen, Salzburg Mozartwoche, Casals Festival Prades,  Festival of Flanders, Aix-en-Provence, Schleswig-Holstein, Kuhmo, Princeton Summer, Caramoor, Chautauqua, and to the Canadian festivals of Ottawa International Chamber, Toronto Summer Music, Music and Beyond, Lanaudiere, Domaine Forget, Orford, Quebec City International, Casals Festival San Juan,  the Morelia and Santa Lucia Festivals in Mexico.

In Vienna, during the first years, the ensemble regularly performed at the Wiener Musikverein;  since 2006  it has been ensemble-in-residence at  the Konzerthaus.  Wigmore Hall named it ensemble-in-residence for 2011/12 and has invited the trio through 2017.  In the 2012/13 season the trio served as resident ensemble for BBC's series at St. Lukes, and since the 2015/16 season now also at the University of Southhampton’s  Turner Sims Hall.

Among the upcoming projects is a collaboration with tenor Park Padmore premiering in 2017 at Wigmore Hall and the Vienna Konzerthaus a work commissioned for Mr. Padmore and the trio with Austrian  composer Thomas Larcher, winner of Lincoln Center’s Elise L. Stoeger Prize 2014/15.

The Trio performed Beethoven's Triple Concerto with orchestras such as the Orchestre Philharmonique Belgique, the English Chamber Orchestra, Orchestre Metropolitain de Montreal, and  the Munich Chamber.  It will perform  the Beethoven and the Casella triple concertos with the Tonkuenstler Orchestra at the 2017 Grafenegg Festival.

Concerts of the ensemble have been repeatedly broadcast on ORF, BBC3, WNYC, NPR stations, and the trio has appeared live on WGBH Boston and St. Paul Sunday, and radio stations world-wide.

Since 2003,  the ensemble has been recording with the German MDG label.   For its many CDs the trio won numerous prestigious prizes, including the Echo Klassik award.   Upcoming releases will be two Brahms recordings in 2016 and the recordings of the Beethoven and Casella Triple concertos with the Vienna Radio Symphony in 2017.

Besides its concert activities, the ensemble has been giving  master classes at Wigmore Hall and the Royal College of Music, at Sydney’s Conservatory of Music, at the University of Wellington as well as in Finland, France, Canada, Mexico, and throughout the USA.

The trio won numerous prizes at international competitions and had among its most important mentors Isaac Stern,  Ralph Kirshbaum,  Joseph Kalichstein as well as members of the Trio di Trieste,  the Beaux Arts Trio, and of the La Salle and Guarneri Quartets.
