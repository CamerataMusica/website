### About the Musicians

LA Cello Quartet is a project of Positive Motions Foundation initiated by Ruslan
Biryukov, founder of the Glendale Philharmonic Orchestra. The ensemble was
introduced first at the Los Angeles Philharmonic Fundraiser in Palos Verdes in
May 2010. Music making by four charismatic cellists-soloists immediately
attracted attention of the public and the quartet was instantly placed into a
category of the leading chamber music groups.
