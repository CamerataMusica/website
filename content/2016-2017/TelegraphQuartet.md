### About the Musicians

The Telegraph Quartet was formed in 2013 with a passionate commitment to the
standard chamber music repertoire as well as contemporary and non-standard repertoire alike. 
The Telegraph Quartet won the prestigious Grand Prize in the 2014 Fischoff Chamber Music 
Competition and has gone on to perform in concert halls, music festivals, and academic 
institutions in the United States, Germany, Italy and France.

The Telegraph Quartet was greatly honored by being the only American quartet of the 
fifteen invited from around the world to perform in Paris in a showcase for young quartets at 
the 2016 Biennale de quatuors à cordes (Biennial String Quartet Festival and Symposium). 

The quartet's 2015 appearances included a New York début in Carnegie Hall / Weill 
Recital Hall, a European début in the Emilia Romagna Music Festival (Italy), Kneisel Hall 
Chamber Music Festival, Chautauqua Music Festival, Capistrano Chamber Music Festival, 
Chicago Chamber Music Society, Chamber Music Yellow Springs, and other engagements.  
Highlights of past seasons include three concerts featured as Guest Artists for the San 
Francisco Conservatory of Music’s Chamber Music Masters Series, a residency with San 
Francisco Friends of Chamber Music’s Presidio Sessions, and a tour of the Mid-West states of 
Indiana, Michigan, and Illinois, sponsored by the Fischoff Foundation. Telegraph has 
participated in many music festivals, including the Great Lakes Music Festival in Detroit and 
Robert Mann’s Quartet Seminar at the Manhattan School of Music. The Telegraph Quartet was 
awarded a grant from the San Francisco Friends of Chamber Music to help fund their début 
CD of string quartets by Webern and Kirchner, to be released in 2016.

The Telegraph Quartet collaborates with pianist Simone DInnerstein, cellist Norman 
Fischer, and the Henschel Quartett from Germany.

Beyond the concert stage, the Telegraph Quartet seeks to spread its music through 
education and audience engagement. The Quartet has given master classes at the San 
Francisco Conservatory of Music’s Collegiate and Pre-College Division as well as the Chicago 
Youth Symphony Orchestra. The members of the Quartet hold teaching positions at various 
music institutions including San Francisco Conservatory of Music’s Chamber Music Program 
and Young Chamber Musicians in San Francisco’s South Bay.  

The Telegraph Quartet is based in the San Francisco Bay Area.
