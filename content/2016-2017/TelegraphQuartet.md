### About the Musicians

The Telegraph Quartet recently won the 2016 Naumburg Chamber Music Competition, a prize that helped launch the careers of groups including the Pacifica, Brentano and Emerson string quartets and the Eroica Trio. The prize carries with it a performance at Carnegie Hall / Weill Recital Hall and a commissioned work by esteemed American composer Robert Sirota.

The quartet also won the prestigious Grand Prize in the 2014 Fischoff Chamber Music Competition after playing together for less than a year. They were the only American quartet of the fifteen from around the world invited to showcase at the 2016 Paris Biennale de quatuors à cordes (Biennial String Quartet Festival and Symposium). 

The Telegraph Quartet was formed in 2013 with a passionate commitment to the standard repertoire as well as contemporary and new music. Recent appearances include a New York début in Carnegie Hall / Weill Recital Hall, a European début in the Emilia Romagna Music Festival (Italy), Kneisel Hall Chamber Music Festival, Chautauqua Music Festival, Capistrano Chamber Music Festival, Chicago Chamber Music Society, Chamber Music Yellow Springs, and Great Lakes Music Festival. They have given three concerts on the San Francisco Conservatory’s Chamber Music Masters Series, and a tour of the Midwest sponsored by the Fischoff Foundation. They have participated Robert Mann’s Quartet Seminar at the Manhattan School of Music and the St. Lawrence Quartet's workshop at Stanford University. Their début CD of Webern, Britten and Kirchner will be released in 2017.

The quartet collaborates with pianist Simone Dinnerstein, cellist Norman Fischer, violist James Dunham (formerly of the Cleveland Quartet) and the Henschel Quartett from Germany.

Beyond the concert stage, the Telegraph Quartet seeks to spread its music through education and audience engagement. They have given master classes at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music and the Chicago Youth Symphony Orchestra. The quartet members hold teaching positions at various music institutions including San Francisco Conservatory of Music’s Chamber Music Program and Young Chamber Musicians in San Francisco’s South Bay.  

The Telegraph Quartet is based in the San Francisco Bay area.
