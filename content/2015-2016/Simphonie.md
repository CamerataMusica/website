### Artiest Bio

<b>Ingrid Matthews</b> has long been established as one of the leading baroque violinists of her generation. She founded the <a href="http://www.seattlebaroque.org/" target="_blank">Seattle Baroque Orchestra</a> with <a href="http://www.byronschenkman.com/" target="_blank">Byron Schenkman</a> in 1992, and served as Music Director until stepping down from that position in 2013.

Matthews won first prize in the 1989 Erwin Bodky International Competition for Early Music, and since that time has performed extensively around the world with numerous period-instrument ensembles. She has served as concertmaster for orchestras such as the <a href="http://www.nycollegium.org/" target="_blank">New York Collegium,</a> the <a href="http://www.bemf.org/" target="_blank">Boston Early Music Festival Orchestra,</a> and <a href="http://www.musicaangelica.org/" target="_blank">Musica Angelica</a> (Los Angeles); and has appeared as a guest director and soloist with many others including the New York Collegium, the <a href="http://www.brandenburg.com.au/" target="_blank">Australian Brandenburg Orchestra,</a> the <a href="http://www.magnoliabaroque.com/" target="_blank">Magnolia Baroque Festival Orchestra</a> (Winston-Salem, NC), <a href="http://www.newtrinitybaroque.org/" target="_blank">New Trinity Baroque</a> (Atlanta), the <a href="http://www.bachsinfonia.org/" target="_blank">Bach Sinfonia</a> (Washington DC), Les Idees Heureuses (Montreal), the Indianapolis Baroque Orchestra, and the Victoria Symphony. For close to a decade she was first violinist of the ensemble La Luna, which specialized in 17th-century music, touring and recording to great critical acclaim.

Matthews' career as a chamber musician has taken her to such venues as the Frick Collection (New York), the Boston Early Music Festival, the Berkeley Festival, Netwoork voor Oude Muziek (the Netherlands), the Getty Center (LA), the Pittsburgh Renaissance and Baroque Society, Early Music Vancouver, Woodstock Concerts, the Cambridge Society for Early Music, the Newberry Library (Chicago), CBC-Toronto, the San Francisco Early Music Society and the Library of Congress, among many others.

Matthews has won international critical acclaim for a <a href="http://www.ingridmatthews.com/music/discography.html" target="_blank">discography</a> ranging from the earliest solo violin repertoire through the Sonatas and Partitas of J.S. Bach. The latter recording was named by Third Ear's Classical Music Listening Companion as "the finest complete set of these works," and the critic for American Record Guide writes "this superb recording is my top recommendation for this music… on either modern or period instruments."

Ingrid Matthews has served on the faculties of the University of Toronto, the University of Washington, Indiana University, the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, the <a href="http://www.longy.edu/" target="_blank"International Baroque Institute at Longy,</a> and <a href="http://www.amherstearlymusic.org/" target="_blank">Amherst Early Music;</a> and has given master classes in baroque repertoire and style at numerous colleges and universities.  She is currently on the faculty of <a href="http://www.cornish.edu/" target="_blank">Cornish College of the Arts in Seattle.</a>  Ingrid Matthews is a graduate of Indiana University, where she studied with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Gingold" target="_blank">Josef Gingold</a> and <a href="http://info.music.indiana.edu/sb/page/normal/898.html" target="_blank">Stanley Ritchie</a>.

Ingrid Matthews is also known as Ingrid Matthews Olson. A passionate life-long interest in the visual arts has led her to amass an eclectic training in various techniques, and her <a href="F:\CamerataMusica2015-2016\Workups\Simphonie\Macintosh HD:\Users\general\Desktop\art\index.html" target="_blank">paintings</a> have been shown in group and solo exhibitions in Seattle and elsewhere.
