### Artiest Bio

Trio Tremonti presents three internationally-acclaimed artists, joined together with a deep musical bond: Mexican-born violinist **Saul Bitrán**, Chilean cellist **Jan Müller-Szeraws**, and Israeli pianist **Sally Pinkas**. Now in its third year as Ensemble-in-Residence at the Cambridge School of Weston, Trio Tremonti members are also Artists-in-residence at the College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts (Bitrán and Müller-Szeraws), and the Hopkins Center in New Hampshire (Pinkas).

Violinist **Saul Bitrán** has been first violinist with Grammy award-winning Cuarteto Latinoamericano since 1986. A graduate of the Rubin Academy of Music at Tel Aviv University, Bitrán tours worldwide and has recorded extensively with the Cuarteto. As a soloist, he has played with orchestras such as the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Seattle Symphony, Dallas Symphony and National Arts Center Orchestra among many others. The Cuarteto Latinoamericano, recipient of the Mexican government Fine Arts Medal, served as Quartet in Residence at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh between 1987 and 2008. Currently, the Cuarteto heads the Latin American Academy for String Quartets, in Caracas, Venezuela, under the auspices of the Sistema. Saul Bitrán is Artist in Residence at the College of the Holy Cross, in Worcester, MA.

Cellist **Jan Müller-Szeraws's** musical journey has taken him over three continents as a soloist, chamber musician and teacher. Recent performances include solo engagements with the New England Philharmonic, the Concord Orchestra, the Boston Landmarks Orchestra, the Moscow Symphony Orchestra, Orquesta Sinfónica de Concepción and Orquesta de la Universidad de Santiago de Chile. His recording of the Allende cello concerto with the Orquesta Sinfónica de Chile has been released by the Chilean Academy of Fine Arts. Other recent recordings include Bernard Hoffer's "Concerto di Camera II" for cello and ensemble written for him and Boston Musica Viva, a CD for Cello, Tabla and Carnatic soprano with works by composer Shirish Korde and Brahms and Chopin sonatas with pianist Adam Golka for Hammond Performing Arts. He is member of contemporary music ensemble Boston Musica Viva, is currently on faculty at the Phillips Academy Andover and has recently been appointed Artist-in-Residence and Chamber Music Coordinator at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, MA. He is a grant recipient of the Saul and Naomi Cohen Foundation.

Following her London debut at Wigmore Hall, Israeli-born pianist **Sally Pinkas** has been heard as recitalist and chamber musician throughout the USA, Europe, Asia, Russia and Nigeria. She has appeared as soloist with the Boston Pops, Aspen Philharmonia, Jupiter Symphony and the Bulgarian Chamber Orchestra. Summer credits include the festivals at Marlboro, Tanglewood, Aspen, Monadnock, Apple Hill and Rockport, as well as Kfar Blum in Israel, Officina Scotese in Italy and Masters de Pontlevoy in France. Pinkas's extensive solo discography features works by Schumann, Fauré, Debussy, Martinu and Rochberg, released on Naxos, MSR and Centaur.. Pinkas appears regularly with her husband, pianist Evan Hirsch (The Hirsch-Pinkas Piano Duo), and with Ensemble Schumann (with oboist Tom Gallant and violist Steve Larson). Pianist-in-residence at the Hopkins Center at Dartmouth College, she is Professor of Music at Dartmouth's Music Department.
