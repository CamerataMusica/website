### About the Musicians


Ensemble Caprice has been hailed by the New York Times as “an ensemble, that encourages the listener to rehear the world”.

**In 2019 the Caprice will celebrate its 30th anniversary!**

Founded by acclaimed conductor, composer and recorder soloist Matthias Maute, Ensemble Caprice has become known for its innovative and adventuresome approach to an increasingly expanding musical repertoire on period instruments.

In addition to its series of concerts in Montreal, the group tours extensively, giving dozens of concerts in Quebec, Canada, the USA, Europe, and even Asia. The ensemble is a regular guest at many prestigious European festivals: the Lufthansa Festival of Baroque Music in London, the Bruges (Belgium) and Utrecht (Netherlands) festivals, the Felicia Blumenthal International Music Festival in Tel Aviv; and in Germany, the Musikfestspiele Potsdam Sanssouci, the Regensburg Early Music Festival, the Händel-Festspiele in Halle, and the Stockstadt festival. The New York Times published a lengthy article hailing the musicians’ innovative and refreshing approach, praising them as “imaginative (and) powerful; the playing is top-flight”.

The Ensemble’s recording activity is every bit as impressive: Their CDs have gained many honors and much critical acclaim. The CD Gloria! Vivaldi and his Angels received a JUNO Award and three prestigious Prix Opus awards. Ensemble Caprice was also recognized for its artistic approach and the quality of its performances by being selected “People’s choice and was a finalist in the music category for the Montreal Arts Council’s Grand Prix de Montréal. The group also earned a nomination for the Echo Klassic award in Germany and the acclaimed publication Gramophone Magazine chose the group’s CD Telemann and the Baroque Gypsies as one of its recommended recordings.

In 2015 and 2016 the ensemble went twice to China and represented Canada at the festival Meet in Beijing. In 2017 the Ensemble will be touring in Central America, South America and again in China.

Ensemble Caprice produces videos for the website noncerto which promote classical music in a new way. The videos have been viewed in more than 150 countries around the world.

In the USA the CD Chaconne-Voices of Eternity has been selected CD of the year 2016 by Radio WBRB in Boston.
