### About the Musicians

Frisson is an explosive group of rising classical stars who are the best of the recent graduates of the top music schools, including Juilliard, Curtis and Yale. Led by Artistic Director and oboist Thomas Gallant, the musicians were chosen through auditions, and the group already has an impressive tour schedule this season including upcoming debuts in New York City and at the Bermuda Festival.  The members of the group all have impressive bios and many have already performed at such prestigious venues as the Verbier, Aspen, Marlboro, and Ravinia Festivals as well as at Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center’s David Geffen Hall.  Frisson programs include music with different combinations of strings and winds, and the core group of violin, viola, cello, bass, flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon and horn perform such works as the Beethoven Septet, Prokoviev Quintet, Schubert Octet and the Martinu Octet.  Frisson also expands into a larger group for performances of the complete Brandenburg Concerti as well as a small chamber orchestra for symphonies of Haydn and Mozart.  Frisson is based in New York City.
