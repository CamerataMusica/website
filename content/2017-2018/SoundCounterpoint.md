### About the Musicians

Established in 2014, **sound|counterpoint** is charming audiences throughout the Pacific Northwest and beyond with its performances of music of the late Renaissance, the Baroque, and 21st century on period instruments. Based in Seattle and Renton, this new ensemble has quickly gained a reputation for performances of expressive generosity, spontaneity, vivacity, and virtuosity. **sound|counterpoint’s** members – Miyo Aoki, recorder; Curtis Foster, oboe; Linda Melsted, violin; and Jonathan Oddie, harpsichord – regularly appear with many of North America’s top ensembles, including Seattle Baroque Orchestra, Portland Baroque Orchestra, American Bach Soloists, Pacific Music Works, and Pacific Baroque Orchestra.
