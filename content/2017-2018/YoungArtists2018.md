Every year, Camerata celebrates the end of the season with a tribute to local music students.  About 15-20 participants are selected from a group nominated by their teachers on the basis of performance at adjudications and competitions.

Music teachers can submit an application form on behalf of a student.

If you have questions about this event, please send an email to [youngartists@cameratamusica.com](mailto:youngartists@cameratamusica.com).
