Chamber Music for the Tri-Cities

#### Camerata Musica, the only organization in the Tri-Cities that regularly schedules chamber music concerts, announces its 2019-2020 season
-->

Dear Camerata Musica Supporter,

First things, first – I hope you are all healthy and surviving this plague year as well as possible.
 
This has traditionally been the time of the year to sit down and write to Camerata supporters about our upcoming season, telling you about our upcoming season, and asking for your support. Things are a little different this year - this isn’t a fundraiser but an opportunity to tell you about Camerata’s current situation.
 
Several months ago, the Board of Directors made the decision that the earliest we would consider having a concert would be January 2022. Unfortunately, Benton and Franklin counties are not doing well: Our Covid-19 case rates are high and our vaccination rates are low. The New York Times currently describes our area as having “extremely high risk” of contracting the disease. Keeping in mind that a large percentage of our audience is older, and therefore at higher risk than the population at large, we honestly don’t know when we will restart. We don’t plan to book artists until we can feel comfortable that having a concert will be reasonably safe for everyone. What does a safe concert look like? Masks? Proof of vaccination? These are good questions that we don’t have any answers for now, but they are questions that we will be exploring.

As you know, it’s been our practice for many years to designate as patrons those who donate at least $100 annually, and to extend priority seating privileges to them for one year. We decided to freeze the patron list as of February 2019, and to extend everyone’s status through the end of whatever spring 2022 season we have. If you were a patron then, you are a patron now. Our next fundraising letter will go out in about a year, at the start of the 2022-2023 season.

Thank you for your patience as we try to sort out the options. We will get back to presenting live chamber music as soon as we can. As always, if you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact me via email ((cndorans@charter.net)[mailto:cndorans@charter.net]).

Sincerely,

Nancy Doran

### Camerata Update

This season’s concerts are scheduled for two different locations.  Some will take place in the [Performance Theatre at Columbia Basin College in Pasco](https://www.google.com/maps/place/CBC+Arts+Center,+Pasco,+WA+99301/@46.2508062,-119.1227316,19z/), while others will be held at [First Presbyterian Church in Kennewick](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kennewick+First+Presbyterian+Church/@46.2086615,-119.1480316,17z/).  We are very grateful to both institutions for welcoming us so warmly to their facilities.

 We are extremely fortunate that Battelle, operator of Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, has donated its Steinway piano to Camerata.  Pianists on our series have played (and praised) this instrument since 1988 when Battelle originally purchased it for our use.  The piano will be located at Kennewick First Presbyterian Church.

 Information about each concert’s location will be included on this website, our Facebook page, next season’s flyers and posters, and our [announcement emails](http://eepurl.com/cD1Zvv), as well as on the reminder cards we send to [patrons](https://www.cameratamusica.com/pages/supporting-camerata-musica.html).

 We look forward to having you join us for another season of chamber music.
