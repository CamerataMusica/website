### Camerata Update

This season’s concerts are scheduled for two different locations.  Some will take place in the [Performance Theatre at Columbia Basin College in Pasco](https://www.google.com/maps/place/CBC+Arts+Center,+Pasco,+WA+99301/@46.2508062,-119.1227316,19z/), while others will be held at [First Presbyterian Church in Kennewick](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kennewick+First+Presbyterian+Church/@46.2086615,-119.1480316,17z/).  We are very grateful to both institutions for welcoming us so warmly to their facilities.

We are extremely fortunate that Battelle, operator of Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, has donated its Steinway piano to Camerata.  Pianists on our series have played (and praised) this instrument since 1988 when Battelle originally purchased it for our use.  The piano will be located at Kennewick First Presbyterian Church.

 Information about each concert’s location will be included on this website, our Facebook page, next season’s flyers and posters, and our [announcement emails](http://eepurl.com/cD1Zvv), as well as on the reminder cards we send to [patrons](https://www.cameratamusica.com/pages/supporting-camerata-musica.html).

We look forward to having you join us for another season of chamber music.
