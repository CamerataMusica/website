# About Camerata Musica

Camerata Musica programs feature chamber music concerts by solo musicians and small ensembles. Performers include local, national, and internationally known musicians.

Camerata does not sell tickets to its programs. Support is provided primarily by donations from individual patrons, with additional funding received from corporate sponsorship and grants from organizations like the Washington State Arts Commission and the National Endowment for the Arts and Three Rivers Community Foundation.

In addition to receiving recognition on the program, patrons (donors who contribute $100.00 or more a year) receive an announcement card before each concert. By presenting these reminders, patrons and their families (2 adults and accompanying children under 18) receive priority seating until 7:45, after which everyone is admitted on a first-come, first-seated basis.
