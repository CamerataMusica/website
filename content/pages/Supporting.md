# Please Support Camerata Musica

Camerata Musica depends on the generosity of those attending concerts to support its activities. Most of our funding comes from individual patrons, with occasional additional funding from corporate sponsorship, local foundations, and grants from organizations like ArtsWa (the Washington State Arts Commission) and the National Endowment for the Arts.

Donors who contribute a minimum of $100.00 each season to Camerata are designated “patrons” and their names appear as such on the program. In addition, patrons receive a reminder card prior to each concert. By presenting this card at the concert _before_ 7:45 p.m., they receive priority seating for themselves and their family (defined as two adults and accompanying children under 18). After 7:45, members of the public and patrons are admitted on a first-come, first-seated basis.

Patrons making a donation of at least $300 per year will be able to bring an additional 2 guests with them when they present their reminder card _prior_ to 7:45.

Individuals making a minimum donation of $500 will be acknowledged as concert co-sponsors and invited to join the Board at a reception for the artists.  

Organizational/corporate co-sponsorship is available with a minimum donation of $1000.00.

Donors paying the entire fee for a concert will be recognized as program sponsors. Since these costs vary from program to program, please contact us for more information.

Patrons who make substantial gifts to Camerata over a five-year period are acknowledged as Benefactors at either the silver ($10,000) or gold ($20,000) level.

Donations to Camerata may be made at any concert or by sending a check to Camerata Musica, PO Box 615, Richland WA 99352.
