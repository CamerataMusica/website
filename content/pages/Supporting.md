# Please Support Camerata Musica

Camerata Musica is supported primarily by donations from individual patrons, with additional funding from corporate sponsorship, and grants from organizations like the Washington State Arts Commission and the National Endowment for the Arts.

Donors who contribute a minimum of $80.00 each season to Camerata are designated “patrons” and their names appear as such on the program. In addition, patrons receive a reminder card prior to each concert. By presenting this card at the concert before 7:45 p.m., they receive priority seating. After 7:45, members of the public and patrons are admitted on a first-come, first-seated basis.

Individuals making a minimum donation of $500 will be acknowledged as a concert co-sponsor. Organizational /corporate co-sponsorship is available at the $1000.00 level.

Donors paying the entire fee for a concert will be recognized as program sponsors. Since these costs vary from program to program, please contact us for more information.

Patrons who make substantial gifts to Camerata over a five-year period are acknowledged as Benefactors at either the silver ($10,000) or gold ($20,000) level.

Donations to Camerata, may be made at any concert or by sending a check to Camerata Musica, PO Box 615, Richland WA 99352.
